# chess_bot
This is a simple chess bot. It uses UCI format for communication with GUI. There are alpha-beta and a couple of other prunings implemented. Meanwhile it doesn't use any endgames or openings bases. The playstyle is very aggressive (and dumb). It's level is around 1500 rating online. You can play against it here (if it is online): https://lichess.org/@/some_weird_bot

It uses UCI protocol for interaction with GUI.
